<h3 id="why"><?php echo _('Why should I move to Linux?'); ?></h3>

<?php echo _('Ok, so your installation of Windows \'works fine\' so why should you bother about Linux?<br />
Good question.'); ?><br /><br />

<?php echo _('There are many reasons why you might want to \'make the move\' to Linux. Here are some of them:'); ?><br />

<h4 id="viruses"><?php echo _('Viruses and Spyware'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux does not suffer from virus and spyware problems like Windows does. This is because of the secure way Linux was designed. Imagine not having to worry about getting a virus or opening that email attachment! Feel confident when using your computer.'); ?><br />

<h4 id="security"><?php echo _('Security and Stability'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux is designed to be stable, safe and secure. Due to the nature of open source software, any security flaws are fixed very quickly. The world\'s best programmers and thousands of people contribute to the programs you would use everyday and this means you get the best software packages available which are continually being improved. In the much less frequent case of an application either misbehaving or crashing, Linux itself rarely fails completely. This results in your computer normally remaining active and usable. No more \'reboot and try again\' syndrome! Often these situations can be resolved quite quickly using the tools available within Linux rather than purchased in addition to the operating system itself. You can access helpful log files and if you have the skills even the source code of the software, not to mention there\'s a great community of users willing to help! Using Linux puts you in control of your computer and you can rest knowing your system is safe, secure, and the software will always exist. Security updates are always available and you don\'t have to worry about issues like Microsoft no-longer supporting your version of Windows and having to pay for an upgrade (and probably a new computer!).'); ?><br />

<h4 id="package"><?php echo _('Package Management'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('You can search for and install software on your Linux computer in a single convenient application. No searching the internet for the files you need or fumbling through the latest CD you got in the mail, just hit the install button to watch Linux download the required files from the internet and install them for you. Not only this, but once you have your system and applications installed, Linux keeps track of all of the application updates automatically, regardless of whether you have used those applications before or even knew that they were installed! So whether it\'s a security update, a new version of OpenOffice.org, or even the core Linux system itself, it is all handled seamlessly and easily. And, most importantly, being open source you know you can trust the software that is being installed!'); ?>

<h4 id="features"><?php echo _('Features'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux is often at the forefront of computer technology and innovation. It is not bound by the same pressures as commercial entities and people are free to be creative and innovative. Some examples of where Linux has already included features before Windows are: fancy 3D desktop effects with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fXgl">Xgl</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://beryl-project.org/">beryl</a>; TV and media centre with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythtv</a>; desktop searching with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beagle-project.org">beagle</a>; desktop widgets with <a target="_blank" href="http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/">superkaramba</a>; and many more. Plus, Linux is available for free right now!'); ?>

<h4><?php echo _('Compatibility'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux runs on anything. In fact it is the most widely supported operating system in the world! From brand new computers to old ones you were going to throw away there is always a Linux version for you. With Linux you can still browse websites all over the internet, watch movies, listen to your music, access your digital camera, use your scanner and much much more. You can also send emails and create documents that are compatible with Windows systems.'); ?><br />

<h4 id="freedom"><?php echo _('Free (as in freedom)'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux is free open source software. This might not mean much to you if you are not a programmer but even if you are just an end user it means you can <em>trust</em> the software (see the section on \'<a href="foss.php">What is FOSS?</a>\' for more information). Free open source software is also gaining popularity all over the world and is on the rise. Now is a good time to start learning a valuable new skill set.'); ?>

<h4 id="foc"><?php echo _('Free (as in price)'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('You might think that your computer came with Windows for free, but you actually <em>did</em> pay for it (unless it\'s an illegal copy). Linux however, actually <em>is</em> free. Forget worrying about pirated software! From complete office suites to media programs and internet applications, the open source software that comes with Linux is not only fully featured, it doesn\'t cost a cent.'); ?><br />

<h4 id="easy"><?php echo _('Easy and Intuitive'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('A single 20 minute install of Linux will set up all your software <em>and</em> all your hardware in one go! You don\'t need to waste time searching for driver disks and going through the frustration of installing all your software. Once your Linux system is installed you will find it is very simple and easy to use. Linux is continually being improved and made more intuitive because people have the freedom to make changes to the software. These are then made available for everyone else to benefit from.'); ?><br />

<h4 id="choice"><?php echo _('Choice and Control'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux also puts you in control by giving you choice. Choice about what software to run and how you run it. You don\'t have to worry about being stuck with one particular program or a set way of doing something. There are thousands of free computer programs available for you to install at the click of a button! Indeed you can even customise the interface to your liking, or choose one of the various Linux versions available that work differently out of the box. Linux is flexible and lets you create a system that works for you. Find or create something that suits you!'); ?><br />

<h4 id="community"><?php echo _('Community'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Everyone using Linux does so because they <em>chose</em> to, not because they had to. People develop Linux because they have a passion for it, not because they do it for money or market share. This means things are done for the <em>right</em> reasons. Users are always willing to help others and Linux is a global collaboration effort. The Linux community is made up of people just like you and it\'s a great community to be a part of.'); ?><br />

<h4 id="fun"><?php echo _('Fun!'); ?></h4>
<?php echo _('Linux is also FUN to use. Imagine actually enjoying using your computer again! There\'s just something great about running Linux on your computer, even computer savvy people will be impressed!'); ?><br /><br />
