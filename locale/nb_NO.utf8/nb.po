Wine is not an emulator but mimics many of the Windows system functions (you do not need Windows installed on your computer). This allows you to install your Windows software through wine and then run it under Linux. Not all Windows software works using this method, but many (such as the Australian Tax Office's 'eTax') work with minimum effort.

There are a few however, like the Unreal Tournament and Quake series of games, which already run perfectly under Linux. The main reason for this is that they use the OpenGL 3D rendering engine, which is open source and runs under Linux natively. Many other games use Microsoft's closed source DirectX 3D engine which will only run on Windows. Once again wine comes to the rescue here as many games will run through it."

Even better, some programs like the <a href=\"http://openoffice.org\">OpenOffice.org</a> suite can even read and write Microsoft Office files. As of version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org supports Microsoft Office 95, 97, 2000, XP and also 2003 formats (as well as many others including export to PDF). While free open source software file formats exist for most things you are likely to want to do on your computer, you may experience problems when swapping complex Microsoft Office files (such as those with many macros), but it is always improving. As Microsoft owns the source code to these formats they can (and do) change the format with new releases. The default file format for OpenOffice.org however follows the recognised international open document standard <a target=\"_balnk\" href=\"http://www.iso.org/iso/en/commcentre/pressreleases/2006/Ref1004.html\">ISO26300</a> and thus will not change to be incompatible in the future.

Most of these are what is called 'win-hardware'. These devices have a software component which needs to be installed on Windows in order for them work. As Linux does not run Windows software these devices are often hard to configure. Example devices include some wireless cards, some printers, and some internal dialup modems. In many cases the open source community has written their own Linux drivers for these devices, however in some cases the manufacturer may not release sufficient information to make this possible. Fortunately more and more manufacturers are supporting Linux, so hopefully this issue will soon be in the past."

For example, while Linux supports NVIDIA cards well in the 2D arena, there is no open source 3D driver available for them. NVIDIA does provide excellent Linux drivers for their cards however, which take full advantage of their 3D features. You may need to obtain such drivers separately from the manufacturer (they are usually available on their website) to install them on your computer. This is due to licensing restrictions which prevent Linux distributions including them by default. Installation under various Linux distributions is usually well supported though and there are always people willing to help."

msgid "Unfortunately many codecs for common video (and audio) formats have not been written for Linux. However there are packages such as win32codecs which allow Linux to use the Windows codecs to access these formats and play all your videos!

Software DVD players were then each given a decryption key to work with all DVDs.  For various reasons, official Linux DVD software players were not available. As it turned out, the encryption design had some issues and it was discovered that a key was not necessary to access the DVD information."

#: considerations.php:59
msgid "There is a package called libdvdcss which can enable most Linux media players to decrypt and display your DVDs. The use of this package may not be legal in all countries even when used with your own, purchased DVDs. This is due to patent restrictions and digital copyright laws. As such, it is not included with most Linux distributions. If it is legal to use it in your location then installing it is usually pretty easy, but again there are always people willing to help you if needed."

msgid "As Linux gains in popularity, more and more devices are created to be compatible. There is a good chance that all of your hardware devices will work by default after a Linux install. However to take full advantage of your system you may need to install extra packages such as 3D video drivers and codecs for your commonly used media. Some cheaper 'win-hardware' may not work well under Linux and you might have to wait a while for the latest game or Windows program to be supported through software like wine. If you fall into one of these categories, help to get your system up and running is always available."

Companies which create their own closed source formats make it virtually impossible for anyone else to know how their formats work. Despite this, Linux is compatible with almost every data format in existence and there is generally a freely available program that will read your data. For example, Microsoft Office documents are supported in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://openoffice.org\">OpenOffice.org</a> suite and Adobe Photoshop files are supported in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gimp.org\">Gimp</a>."

Using these formats puts you at the whim of Microsoft who can (and do) make their file formats incompatible with other applications, including older versions of Microsoft Office! Because these files are closed source, people are forced to purchase new versions of Microsoft Office. While some open source office suites can read and write Microsoft formats, the results are sometimes imperfect because we do not have the code to see how the formats work. Still Linux does a great job of working with Microsoft Office files and you will probably find you can use and swap them without issue.

This standard is freely available for anyone to learn and implement (yes, even Microsoft) because it is open source. Due to pressure applied by various Governments switching to this new open format, Microsoft was forced to support this format in their next version of Office. We are not sure to what degree they will support it, however OpenOffice.org already does. Aside from the new open document formats, there are many other formats you can use that are freely usable; HTML, PDF, and even plain text."

In the much less frequent case of an application either misbehaving or crashing, Linux itself rarely fails completely. This results in your computer normally remaining active and usable. No more 'reboot and try again' syndrome! Often these situations can be resolved quite quickly using the tools available within Linux rather than purchased in addition to the operating system itself. You can access helpful log files and if you have the skills even the source code of the software, not to mention there's a great community of users willing to help! Using Linux puts you in control of your computer and you can rest knowing your system is safe, secure, and the software will always exist.
