<?php echo _('Perhaps you want to try out Linux on your own computer? If you\'re ready to jump right in you could install it straight onto your computer\'s hard drive, or you could also test Linux on your computer from a \'Live CD\' without installing it! A Live CD boots your computer into a Linux system running entirely from the CD in your computer\'s memory. It does not install to your hard drive so you can try Linux without needing to change your computer\'s current setup.'); ?><br /><br />

<?php echo _('As mentioned in the \'<a href="linux.php">What is Linux?</a>\' section, there are many versions of Linux, called \'distributions\'. In essence they are all the same but they can have different ways of doing things, such as the way they handle the installation of applications. Different distributions often come with different software by default and some come with different versions of that software. Artwork is often different as can be the layout and feel of the desktop. There are two main user interfaces (desktops) for Linux. One is called \'<a target="_blank" href="http://kde.org">KDE</a>\' and the other is \'<a target="_blank" href="http://gnome.org">GNOME</a>\'. Most distributions come with both, so you test and see which one you prefer to use. Our <a href="gallery.php">gallery</a> contains screenshots of both, so you can see what they look like.<br /><br />

You may like to try a few different Linux distributions until you find one you really like to use. A great resource for distribution news and information can be found at <a href="http://distrowatch.com">Distrowatch.com</a>.'); ?><br /><br />

Linux also tends to be less memory intensive than other operating systems, so it often works well even on older computers.'); ?><br /><br />

<?php echo _('If you have a very old computer however, there are special distributions designed for older machines. Two excellent distributions in this area are <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/">Puppy</a> and <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">Damn Small</a>. They are also Live CDs and can even run on computers with a 486 processor and only 16MB of ram!'); ?><br /><br />

<?php echo _('We suggest you start by downloading a Live CD from one of the distributions listed above, burn it to a blank CD then reboot your computer.

It will also let you see which distribution you might like the most.'); ?>

<h4 id="help"><?php echo _('Documentation and Help'); ?></h4>
